The Stable Diffusion Discord Bot is a Go-based bot that connects Discord to the AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI API. After installing a prebuilt binary (or building from source with Go), you create and add a Discord bot to your server, ensure the A1111 WebUI runs with `--api` (and `--listen` if remote), then launch the bot with your token, guild ID, and WebUI host. On first run it creates a local SQLite database. The bot exposes `/imagine_settings` to set defaults (e.g., image size) and `/imagine` to generate images from prompts, supporting options like `--ar <w>:<h>`; it uses “Hires fix” under the hood and sanitizes/stores parameters for later re-rolls, variations, and upscales.

Internally it maintains a FIFO queue, dispatching one generation at a time to the WebUI and updating the original message on completion with buttons for re-roll, variations, and upscaling. Features include multiple image generation, easy re-rolls, upscaling, and variation grids, with planned additions like per-user settings/limits, richer `/imagine` options, and image-to-image. The project favors Go for easier dependency management and straightforward cross-compilation. Contributions are welcome via issues and pull requests.
